# Heatmaps showing traffic flow using Opal data
* HeatmapsforOpaldata.ipynb shows how I created heatmaps for trafic flow for a specific location (suburd 2000) using only bus Opal tap on and off data.
* This work was my contribution in a group project - assessment, prepared for COMP2200 Data Science 2020.
